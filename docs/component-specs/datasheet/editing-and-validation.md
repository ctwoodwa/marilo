# DataSheet Editing and Validation

MariloDataSheet provides an in-place editing model where every editable cell can be modified directly. The component tracks changes at the cell level, runs validation after each commit, and gates Save All behind a full validation pass. This article describes the complete editing lifecycle, validation rules, dirty state management, and error handling.

## Editing Lifecycle

The DataSheet editing model follows this sequence for every cell edit:

1. **Focus** — the user navigates to a cell via click, Tab, Enter, or arrow keys. The cell becomes the active cell (highlighted with a focus ring).
2. **Enter edit mode** — the user presses F2, starts typing, or double-clicks. The cell transitions from display mode to an inline editor (text input, date picker, dropdown, etc.).
3. **Edit** — the user modifies the value in the editor.
4. **Commit or cancel:**
   * **Commit** (Enter, Tab) — the new value is written to the row, per-cell validation runs, dirty state updates, and `OnRowChanged` fires.
   * **Cancel** (Escape) — the editor closes, the cell reverts to the value it had before entering edit mode, and no events fire.
5. **Post-commit state** — the cell transitions to `CellState.Dirty` if the committed value differs from the original, or remains `CellState.Pristine` if the user committed the same value. If validation fails, the cell transitions to `CellState.Invalid`.

Checkbox columns are an exception: toggling a checkbox commits the value immediately without a separate edit mode step.

## Entering Edit Mode

A cell enters edit mode through any of the following actions:

| Action | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Press **F2** | Opens the editor with the current value. For text columns, the full value is selected. |
| Press any **printable character** | Opens the editor and replaces the current value with the typed character (text and number columns only). |
| **Click** on a focused cell | Opens the editor at the click position. |
| **Double-click** on any cell | Focuses the cell and opens the editor. |
| Call `EnterEditMode(row, field)` | Programmatically opens the editor on the specified cell. |

Cells that are not editable (`Editable="false"` or `ColumnType="Computed"`) ignore all edit mode triggers. Focus still moves to these cells during navigation, but no editor appears.

## Committing and Cancelling

### Commit Triggers

| Trigger | Effect after commit |
| --- | --- |
| **Enter** | Commits and moves focus down to the same column in the next row. |
| **Tab** | Commits and moves focus right to the next editable cell (wraps to the next row at the end). |
| **Shift+Tab** | Commits and moves focus left to the previous editable cell (wraps to the previous row at the start). |
| **Click** outside the editing cell | Commits the current cell. Focus moves to the clicked cell. |
| Call `CommitCellEdit(row, field, value)` | Programmatic commit. Does not move focus. |

### Cancel Trigger

| Trigger | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| **Escape** | Restores the cell to the value it had before entering edit mode. The cell exits edit mode. No events fire. |

### What Happens on Commit

When a cell value is committed, the following steps execute in order:

1. The new value is type-converted (if needed) and written to the `TItem` property via reflection.
2. **Required validation** runs if the column has `Required="true"`.
3. **Column-level validation** runs if the column has a `Validate` delegate.
4. If validation passes, the cell's dirty state is updated by comparing the committed value against the original snapshot.
5. `OnRowChanged` fires with the row, field, old value, and new value.
6. The component re-renders the affected cell (and any computed columns in the same row that may display updated derived values).

If validation fails at step 2 or 3, the cell transitions to `CellState.Invalid`, the error message is stored, and `OnRowChanged` still fires (the value was written to the model). The Save All button remains disabled as long as any cell is invalid.

## Dirty Tracking

The DataSheet maintains an internal dirty tracking system that snapshots the original value of each row when the data is first loaded (or after a reset/save).

**How dirty state works:**

* When `Data` is bound or `SetDataAsync` is called, the component deep-clones each row to create an original snapshot.
* After each cell commit, the new value is compared against the original snapshot for that field.
* If the values differ, the field is added to the row's dirty field set and the cell renders as `CellState.Dirty`.
* If the user edits a cell back to its original value, the field is removed from the dirty set. If no fields remain dirty, the row is no longer considered dirty.
* `GetDirtyRows()` returns only rows that have at least one dirty field.
* `ResetAsync()` discards all dirty state and restores every row to its original snapshot values.

**Row-level dirty tracking:**

* A row is dirty if it has at least one dirty field **or** if it has been marked for deletion.
* Deleted rows are tracked separately and appear in `DataSheetSaveArgs.DeletedRows`.
* The CSS provider receives `isDirty` and `isDeleted` flags for row-level styling.

**Cell state transitions:**

| From | To | Trigger |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Pristine` | `Dirty` | Cell committed with a value different from the original. |
| `Pristine` | `Invalid` | Cell committed but validation failed. |
| `Dirty` | `Pristine` | Cell edited back to the original value. |
| `Dirty` | `Invalid` | Cell re-committed but validation failed. |
| `Invalid` | `Dirty` | Cell re-committed with a valid value that differs from the original. |
| `Invalid` | `Pristine` | Cell re-committed with the original value (and validation passes). |
| `Dirty` | `Saving` | Save All initiated; row is part of the save batch. |
| `Saving` | `Saved` | `OnSaveAll` handler completes without error. |
| `Saved` | `Pristine` | Brief visual indicator period ends; the saved snapshot becomes the new original. |

## Per-Cell Validation

Per-cell validation runs automatically after every cell commit. Two validation layers execute in order:

### 1. Required Validation

If the column has `Required="true"`, the component checks whether the committed value is considered "empty" for the column type (see the [Required Fields table](slug:datasheet-columns-and-schema#required-fields)). If empty, the cell is marked `CellState.Invalid` with the message `"{Title} is required."`.

### 2. Column Validate Delegate

If the column has a `Validate` delegate, it is invoked with the full row instance. The delegate returns `null` if valid or an error message string if invalid.

```csharp
// Example: cross-field validation on a column
Validate="@(row => row.EndDate < row.StartDate
    ? "End date must be after start date"
    : null)"
```

If the delegate returns an error, the cell is marked `CellState.Invalid` with the returned message. The required check and the custom validate delegate are independent — both can produce errors, but only one error message is displayed (the required error takes priority if both fail).

## Pre-Save Validation (OnValidate)

The `OnValidate` event fires as part of the Save All flow, **after** all per-cell validation has passed. It provides an opportunity for the caller to perform cross-row, server-side, or business-rule validation that individual column validators cannot express.

**Contract:**

1. Save All is invoked (via Ctrl+S, the Save All button, or `SaveAllAsync()`).
2. The component runs `ValidateAllAsync()` — iterating all dirty rows and executing required + column-level validation. If any cell is invalid, Save All is aborted and the invalid cells are highlighted.
3. If all cells pass, `OnValidate` fires with a `DataSheetValidateArgs<TItem>` containing the dirty rows and an empty `Errors` list.
4. The handler inspects the dirty rows and appends `DataSheetValidationError<TItem>` entries to the `Errors` list for any failures.
5. After the handler returns, if `Errors` is non-empty, Save All is aborted. Each error is mapped to its cell (`Row` + `Field`), and those cells transition to `CellState.Invalid` with the error `Message`.
6. If `Errors` is empty, `OnSaveAll` fires with the `DataSheetSaveArgs<TItem>`.

>caption OnValidate handler example

````RAZOR
<MariloDataSheet TItem="BudgetLine" Data="@_lines" KeyField="Id"
                 OnValidate="@ValidateBudget"
                 OnSaveAll="@SaveBudget">
    @* columns omitted for brevity *@
</MariloDataSheet>

@code {
    void ValidateBudget(DataSheetValidateArgs<BudgetLine> args)
    {
        decimal totalBudget = args.DirtyRows.Sum(r => r.Amount);
        if (totalBudget > 1_000_000m)
        {
            // Mark the Amount cell on the last row as the error location
            var lastRow = args.DirtyRows.Last();
            args.Errors.Add(new DataSheetValidationError<BudgetLine>
            {
                Row = lastRow,
                Field = "Amount",
                Message = $"Total budget ({totalBudget:C}) exceeds the $1M limit."
            });
        }
    }
}
````

>important `OnValidate` is synchronous by design. If you need to call an async service (e.g., server-side uniqueness check), perform the check before Save All by calling `ValidateAllAsync()` manually and adding errors to a shared state, or use `OnSaveAll` to reject the save by re-setting `IsSaving` to `false` and displaying an error banner.

## Validation Error Display

When a cell is in `CellState.Invalid`:

* The cell receives the CSS class from `DataSheetCellClass(CellState.Invalid, ...)`, typically rendering a red border or background.
* The cell's `title` attribute contains the error message, providing a tooltip on hover.
* The cell has `aria-invalid="true"` for screen readers.
* The error message is also available in `DataSheetCellContext.ValidationError` for use in custom `CellTemplate` rendering.

The Save All button (or Ctrl+S) is disabled as long as any cell in the sheet is in `CellState.Invalid`. The dirty count indicator in the save footer shows the number of dirty rows, but does not include invalid-only rows in the count.

## Editing Lifecycle Sequence

The following prose sequence describes the full editing and save flow from a user's perspective:

1. The user clicks on a cell displaying "100.00" in a Number column. The cell receives focus (active state).
2. The user presses F2. The cell enters edit mode, showing a numeric input with "100" selected.
3. The user types "250" and presses Tab.
4. The component writes `250` to the row's property. Required validation passes (non-null). The column `Validate` delegate runs and returns `null` (valid). The original snapshot value was `100`, so the cell transitions to `CellState.Dirty`. `OnRowChanged` fires with `OldValue=100, NewValue=250`. Focus moves to the next editable cell.
5. The user edits two more cells in other rows, then presses Ctrl+S.
6. The component runs `ValidateAllAsync()`: it iterates all three dirty rows, re-running required and column validation on each dirty field. All pass.
7. `OnValidate` fires. The handler checks business rules and adds no errors.
8. All dirty cells transition to `CellState.Saving`. `OnSaveAll` fires with `DirtyRows` containing the three modified rows.
9. The caller sets `IsSaving=true`, persists changes to the backend, then sets `IsSaving=false`.
10. The component transitions saved cells to `CellState.Saved` briefly, then to `CellState.Pristine`. The saved values become the new original snapshots.

## Programmatic Editing

The following public methods allow programmatic control over editing:

| Method | Returns | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `EnterEditMode(TItem row, string field)` | `void` | Opens the editor on a specific cell. The cell must be editable. |
| `CommitCellEdit(TItem row, string field, object? value)` | `Task` | Writes a value to a cell, runs validation, and updates dirty state. Does not require the cell to be in edit mode. |
| `IsCellEditing(TItem row, string field)` | `bool` | Returns `true` if the specified cell is currently in edit mode. |
| `ValidateAllAsync()` | `Task<bool>` | Runs full validation across all dirty rows without triggering Save All. Returns `true` if all cells are valid. |

These methods are available via the component `@ref` and are useful for scenarios where editing must be orchestrated from outside the DataSheet (e.g., a toolbar button that applies a value to all selected cells).
