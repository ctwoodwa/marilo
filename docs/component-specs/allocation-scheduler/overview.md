# Blazor AllocationScheduler Overview

The `MariloAllocationScheduler` is a resource-centric planning component that combines configurable resource metadata columns on the left with editable time-bucket allocation cells on the right. Users assign, redistribute, and analyze task-linked hours or currency values across a navigable timeline with spreadsheet-style editing.

This component occupies its own complexity tier alongside `MariloScheduler` and `MariloGantt`. It is not a mode or view of the existing Scheduler — it is a distinct planning surface designed for staffing, budgeting, and allocation workflows.


## Component Description

A hybrid scheduler component for planning resource assignments over time, using a table-based layout with configurable date granularity and spreadsheet-like bulk editing for task-based hours or cost allocations.

The primary scenario is a project manager who adds a set of resources (people, roles, or teams) to a project, configures a weekly display range defaulting to today plus three months, loads budgeted hours or dollars per resource and task into each visible week, and then edits, redistributes, and analyzes those values as the plan evolves.


## Creating a Blazor AllocationScheduler

1. Use the `<MariloAllocationScheduler>` tag.
2. Bind `Resources` to your list of schedulable entities.
3. Bind `Allocations` to your list of allocation records.
4. Set `AuthoritativeLevel` to the editing granularity — typically `TimeGranularity.Week` or `TimeGranularity.Month`.
5. Optionally set `ViewGrain`, `VisibleStart`, and `ValueMode`.
6. Define `<AllocationResourceColumns>` child tags to configure the left-side columns.

## Domain Model

AllocationScheduler is modeled around four primary entities.

| Entity | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `Resource` | The schedulable entity. Can be a person, role, team, machine, or vendor. Drives the left-side resource columns. |
| `Task` | The work item receiving the allocation. A resource can have multiple tasks. |
| `AllocationRecord` | A single value record: one resource, one task, one time bucket. This is the authoritative, persisted unit of data. |
| `AllocationTarget` | A desired total value for a resource, task, or period. Stored separately; used for delta analysis. |

A key rule: **hours or dollars are never standalone cell values**. Every value belongs to an `AllocationRecord` that carries `ResourceId`, `TaskId`, `BucketStart`, `BucketEnd`, `Value`, and `Unit`. This ensures all operations — shift, move, spread, analyze — have a reliable, auditable record to act on.


## Editing Grain (AuthoritativeLevel)

The most important configuration decision is `AuthoritativeLevel`. This sets the one time granularity at which cell editing is enabled. All coarser zoom levels display read-only aggregate sums. All finer zoom levels show stored authoritative values, not recalculated breakdowns.

See [Editing Grain Design Decision](slug:allocation-scheduler-editing-grain) for full rationale, the Option A vs Option B analysis, and how distribution commands work when a user wants to operate at a coarser level.

> **Design decision: Option A is the baseline.** `AuthoritativeLevel` is a required parameter. Only cells matching the authoritative grain are directly editable. Coarser buckets are read-only rollups. Distribution commands in the context menu let users operate on higher-level periods without bypassing this rule.


## Feature Areas

### Timeline Surface

The right side of the component renders time-bucket columns for the configured view grain. Users can navigate forward and backward, and the visible date range updates accordingly.

- View granularities: `Day`, `Week`, `Month`, `Quarter`, `Year`.
- Configurable default start and range length (e.g., today + 3 months).
- Forward/back navigation via toolbar or programmatic `NavigateTo(DateTime)`.
- Today jump.


### Resource Grid

The left side renders configurable columns for the resource entity.

- `<AllocationResourceColumn>` child tags define fields, titles, widths, and templates.
- Columns support show/hide, resize, reorder, and pinning.
- Optional sorting and filtering on resource fields.
- Optional row hierarchy for grouped or nested resources.


### Allocation Layer

Each resource row can show one or more task layers stacked vertically. Each layer corresponds to one task and renders its allocation values across visible buckets.

- Hours or currency display (`ValueMode`).
- Row totals and period totals.
- Over/under allocation indicators.
- Optional holiday and non-working-time shading.


### Editing

Editing applies only to cells at the `AuthoritativeLevel` zoom.

- **Single-cell edit**: click a cell and type.
- **Drag-fill**: click-and-drag across cells to broadcast or increment values.
- **Keyboard traversal**: Tab moves right, Shift+Tab moves left, Enter moves down, Arrow keys navigate.
- **Range selection**: click and drag to select a rectangle; apply a bulk value.
- **Undo/redo**: built-in for cell-level and range-level edits.


### Context Menu

A right-click context menu surfaces transformation commands. The menu is available at both the authoritative level and at coarser rollup cells, with actions scoped appropriately.

See [Context Menu](slug:allocation-scheduler-context-menu) for the full built-in command list and extension model.

**Built-in commands:**

| Command | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| Set values for selected date range | Authoritative cells |
| Clear values for selected date range | Authoritative cells |
| Shift values forward | Task row, date range |
| Shift values backward | Task row, date range |
| Move values to another task | Task row |
| Move values to another resource | Resource row |
| Spread total evenly across selection | Date range |
| Distribute period total to sub-buckets | Coarser rollup cell |
| Set desired total for task | Task row |
| Set desired total for resource | Resource row |
| Show/hide delta from desired total | Global toggle |


### Analysis and Targets

- `AllocationTarget` records define desired totals for a task, resource, or period.
- Targets are overlays — they never mutate allocation records.
- Delta display shows actual vs target with configurable variance thresholds.
- Status coloring highlights over-allocated, under-allocated, and on-target states.

See [Analysis and Targets](slug:allocation-scheduler-analysis-targets) for parameters and demo scenarios.

## Demo Scenarios

The following scenarios represent the primary coverage targets for AllocationScheduler examples and tests.

1. **Weekly project staffing** — Add 10 people to a project, assign hours by week, navigate across the next 3 months.
2. **Budget planning** — Switch to `ValueMode = Currency`, compare planned cost against target by task.
3. **Bulk adjustment** — Drag-fill hours across a selected date range for one task.
4. **Reallocation** — Move planned effort from one resource to another after a staffing change.
5. **Schedule shift** — Shift a task's allocations forward by two weeks using the context menu.
6. **Variance review** — Set desired totals, enable `ShowDeltas`, highlight over- and under-allocated states.
7. **Read-only rollup navigation** — Set `AuthoritativeLevel = Week`, zoom to Month view, confirm month cells are read-only sums.
8. **Distribution command** — Right-click a month rollup cell, choose Distribute to weeks, confirm stored weekly records match the chosen distribution policy.
