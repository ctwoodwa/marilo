# Accessibility Compliance

This page provides a component-by-component summary of accessibility support in Marilo. All components target **WCAG 2.2 Level AA**. See the [Accessibility Overview](xref:accessibility-overview) for the standards, patterns, and best practices that underpin these ratings.

## How to read this table

| Column | Values | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **Keyboard** | Yes | Full keyboard operability per the applicable ARIA design pattern |
| | Partial | Keyboard navigation works for core interactions; some advanced interactions (e.g., drag, canvas content) are pointer-only |
| | No | Keyboard operation not implemented |
| **WAI-ARIA** | Yes | Component emits correct roles, states, and properties per WAI-ARIA 1.2 and the ARIA APG |
| | Partial | Core ARIA semantics present; some states or live-region announcements may be incomplete |
| | No | No ARIA attributes emitted |
| **Contrast** | AA | Meets WCAG 2.2 Level AA (4.5:1 normal text, 3:1 large text and UI components) |
| | AAA | Meets WCAG 2.2 Level AAA (7:1 normal text) for default token values |

Detailed ARIA attribute tables for each component are available in the component spec documentation under `docs/component-specs/*/accessibility/wai-aria-support.md`.

## How to read this table

**Keyboard: Yes** means the component fully implements the keyboard interaction pattern specified by the ARIA Authoring Practices Guide for its role. A user who navigates exclusively by keyboard can perform all component functions.

**Keyboard: Partial** means keyboard navigation covers the primary use cases but one or more advanced interactions (typically drag operations or canvas-rendered content) are not yet keyboard-accessible. These gaps are tracked in the component gap log.

**WAI-ARIA: Yes** means the component emits the correct `role`, `aria-*` states, and `aria-*` properties for its ARIA design pattern, and keeps them synchronized with runtime state. Detailed attribute tables are in the per-component WAI-ARIA spec.

**WAI-ARIA: Partial** means core semantics are present but some dynamic state announcements or live-region updates may be incomplete.

**Contrast: AA** means the component meets WCAG 2.2 Level AA contrast requirements (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text and UI components) in all standard provider themes (FluentUI, Bootstrap, Material) in both light and dark mode.

For detailed ARIA attributes, roles, and states per component, see the component spec documentation: `docs/component-specs/<ComponentName>/accessibility/wai-aria-support.md`.
