# Overview

Marilo is a **provider-first Blazor component library** that ships 90+ ready-to-use UI components -- buttons, forms, data grids, dialogs, navigation, charts, and more -- while keeping the visual layer completely pluggable.

## What "provider-first" means

Most component libraries hard-code a single design language into every component. Marilo takes a different approach: each component delegates its CSS class names, icon rendering, and JavaScript interop to a **provider**. You choose (or build) the provider that matches your design system, register it at startup, and every Marilo component automatically renders with that look and feel.

```text
Your Razor markup
       |
  MariloButton, MariloCard, MariloDialog ...
       |
  IMariloCssProvider  /  IMariloIconProvider  /  IMariloJsInterop
       |
  FluentUI provider  (or your own)
```

Because the component tree and the styling layer are separate, you can:

- **Switch design systems** by swapping one NuGet package and a single line in `Program.cs`.
- **Create a custom provider** that targets your company's design tokens without forking the library.
- **Share pages and layouts** across projects that use different visual themes.

## Current providers

| Provider | Package | Design system |
|---|---|---|
| Fluent UI | `Marilo.Providers.FluentUI` | Microsoft Fluent UI 2 |

Additional providers are on the roadmap. See [Creating a Custom Provider](xref:theming-custom-provider) if you want to build one today.

## Next steps

- [Installation](xref:getting-started-installation) -- add the NuGet packages and register the provider.
- [First Component](xref:getting-started-first-component) -- render your first `MariloButton`.
