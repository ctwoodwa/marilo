# Resolution Status: Forms/Inputs

## Current Phase
Phase 3: Standard inputs; Phase 4 for advanced components (ColorPicker, DateRangePicker, DateTimePicker, TimePicker, FileUpload, Upload, MaskedInput, MultiSelect, RangeSlider, Rating, SearchBox)

## Gap Summary
23 components total. Key gaps include missing EditContext integration across all input components, DatePicker type mismatch, NumericInput is not generic, Radio is a single button only (not a group). ColorPicker uses native input instead of custom picker. Most standard inputs have 5-6 medium-severity gaps each.

## Resolution Approach
*To be determined during resolution design.*
